## Project Details

### Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to create a Twitter-like application that allows users to post tweets, follow other users, and engage in conversations. The application should provide a user-friendly interface and include features such as real-time updates, notifications, and search functionality.

### Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can create an account, log in, and log out of the application. Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure user data and ensure privacy.
- **Posting Tweets**: Users can compose and post tweets, including text, images, and hashtags. Tweets are displayed in a chronological order.
- **Following Users**: Users can follow other users to see their tweets in their home feed. The home feed displays a timeline of tweets from followed users.
- **Likes and Retweets**: Users can like and retweet tweets. The number of likes and retweets is displayed on each tweet.
- **Commenting**: Users can comment on tweets to engage in conversations. Comments are displayed below the tweet and can be nested.
- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications for activities such as mentions, new followers, likes, and comments.
- **Search**: Users can search for tweets, users, and hashtags using the search functionality.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information, including profile picture, bio, and privacy settings.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and compatible with various devices and screen sizes.
